# Question 01

Warmup: write a function that takes a string of parentheses as an argument and returns true if the parentheses are balanced

e.g. (())() == true, ()) == false


# question 02
Given a grid of booleans, where True is land, False is water, and adjacent lands form an island, count the number of islands

(this has been a popular leetcode medium since 2015)

# question 03
And finally, if I was instructed to focus on datastructures instead of algorithms, I'd askâ€¦ [cont]

Design a datastructure that has this API:

insert(value)
delete(value)
get_uniform_random() -> value

Where all methods are faster than O(N)
